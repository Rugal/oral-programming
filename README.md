#My little dream

I try to make a program that could use speech recognition to do some cool stuffs like programming by recognize coder's word.
It is not very difficult, but it is rather difficult because of the dilemma faced by speech recognition techniques.
This repository is for the command interface usage. As for speech recognition, I will try several famous recognizer.
If anyone has good idea about high accuracy recognizer, please with no hesitation to contribute.
